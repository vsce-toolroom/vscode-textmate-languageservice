This page gives a '''list of domesticated animals''',<ref name="Table of Domesticated Animals">{{cite web|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/dterms/a/domestication.htm|title=How did we ever manage to domesticate so many animals?}}</ref> also including a list of [[domestication of animals|animals which are or may be currently undergoing the process of domestication]] and animals that have an extensive relationship with humans beyond simple predation. This includes species which are semi-domesticated, undomesticated but [[Captive breeding|captive-bred]] on a commercial scale, or commonly wild-caught, at least occasionally captive-bred, and [[Tame animal|tameable]]. In order to be considered fully domesticated, most species have undergone significant [[Heredity|genetic]], [[Behavior|behavioural]] and [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] changes from their wild ancestors, while others have changed very little from their wild ancestors despite hundreds or thousands of years of potential [[selective breeding]]. A number of factors determine how quickly any changes may occur in a species, but there is not always a desire to improve a species from its wild form. Domestication is a gradual process, so there is no precise moment in the history of a given species when it can be considered to have become fully domesticated.

[[Zooarchaeology]] has identified three classes of animal domesticates:
# [[Pets]] ([[dogs]], [[cats]], [[ferrets]], [[hamsters]], etc.)
# [[Livestock]] ([[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[pigs]], [[goats]], etc.)
# [[Beasts of burden]] ([[horses]], [[camels]], [[donkeys]], etc.)<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/659964 |title=The Origins of Agriculture: New Data, New Ideas |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=52 |pages=S163–S174 |year=2011 |last1=Price |first1=T.
